# MapHubs

MapHubs is a collaborative platform for sharing and organzing mapping data, and telling stories with maps.

MapHubs is a modern open-source web mapping stack, built with Mapbox GL graphics-based map rendering using vector tiles (https://www.mapbox.com/maps/), PostGIS (https://postgis.net/) and GDAL (https://gdal.org/) for data storage/processing, and Next.js (https://nextjs.org/) and React (https://reactjs.org/) for the web application, along with many other smaller open-source libraries

## Development

### Installing dependencies

```sh
git clone git@github.com:maphubs/maphubs.git
cd maphubs
npm install
```

### Local configuration

Before running maphubs locally, you will need to update the environment config variables

- In env/dev/secret copy each of the sample files

MapHubs is made of multiple components: a database, the web application (this project), a vector tile server, and a screenshot service. The easiest way to run everything is with Docker.

#### Database

The `db-server` directory contains instructions on running your own postgresql database with the appropriate table schema using Docker.

#### Vector Tile Server
